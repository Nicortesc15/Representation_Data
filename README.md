### Task 1 – Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Applied PCA to:
  - 2D datasets
  - Grayscale images (raccoon)
  - Pedestrian trajectory data
- Investigated energy captured by principal components.
- Achieved effective dimensionality reduction while maintaining data structure.

### Task 2 – Diffusion Maps

- Used diffusion maps for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
- Worked on:
  - A synthetic periodic dataset
  - The swiss-roll dataset
  - Trajectory data
- Unrolled manifolds and studied the impact of data density.

### Task 3 – Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)

- Trained VAEs on the MNIST dataset.
- Analyzed latent space structure with 2D and 32D dimensions.
- Focused on:
  - Reconstruction accuracy
  - Generation quality
  - Effect of KL divergence and latent space size

### Task 4 – Fire Evacuation Model

- Modeled the distribution of people inside a building.
- Trained VAE models on FireEvac dataset.
- Estimated a critical occupancy number based on model-generated data.
